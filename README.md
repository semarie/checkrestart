# NAME
     checkrestart - help to find processes that need restarting after upgrade

# SYNOPSIS
     checkrestart [-v] [-M core] [-N system] [-W swap]

# DESCRIPTION
     checkrestart is a program designed to help to find processes that need
     restarting after upgrade.

     checkrestart walks through the entire file table of the system, searching
     for processes with a VTEXT node detached from the filesystem.

     By default, checkrestart will output the pid and executable name of these
     running processes.

     The options are as follows:

     -v      Verbose mode.  checkrestart will additionally output the inode
             and mount point of the unlinked node.

     -M core
             Extract values associated with the name list from the specified
             core instead of the running kernel.

     -N system
             Extract the name list from the specified system instead of the
             running kernel.

     -W swap
             When not using the running kernel, extract swap information from
             the specified file.

     The typical use case is:

     o   start a long lived program.

     o   later, upgrade your packages via pkg_add -u.

     o   if the program is updated on disk, the running program is still the
         previous one (without security fixes for example).

     o   checkrestart will tell you which processes belong to this category.

# HISTORY
     The name checkrestart comes from a similar tool from Debian that relies
     on lsof(1) for achieving the same purpose.

# AUTHORS
     checkrestart was written by Sebastien Marie <semarie@online.fr>.

# CAVEATS
     Only VTEXT nodes are reported by checkrestart.  Some programs using old
     libraries aren't reported due to lack of kernel support.
